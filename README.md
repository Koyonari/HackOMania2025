# BETterHelp

A community-based platform to help individuals rid addictions through peer
pressure by having the community place bets on whether someone has relapsed.

Volunteers ensure that someone hasn't relapsed by doing random, physical
surprise checks (i.e.: nicotine tests, drug tests, etc.) and uploading
the results to the site. The results are first hidden from the community
as they place their bets, and then revealed to the community once the
time is up.
